# WebScrapingProject
This project is a simple yet powerful Price Tracking Tool for monitoring product prices on Poorvika mobile sale website (or other websites with extension). It uses Selenium WebDriver and BeautifulSoup to extract product prices and compare them against a user-defined target price. Results are saved to a text file for easy reference.
